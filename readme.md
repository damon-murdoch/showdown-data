# showdown data
## A command line utility for displaying Pokemon data
### Developed by Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://twitter.com/SirScrubbington)).

## Introduction
showdown-data is a command line application written in Go for viewing Pokemon information
such as data for pokemon, moves, items and abilities. It is intended for use as a quick
reference command line tool, similar to the Pokemon Showdown !data command. 

This application was made during my process of learning Go, and while there are changes I 
would like to make to the application I do not currently use it and it is not supported.

## Future Changes
A list of future planned fixes / improvements are listed below.
